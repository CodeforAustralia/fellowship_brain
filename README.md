# Context

One lesson we gleaned from previous mentoring is a common set of concepts all mentors encountered. Rather than continually retell the fellowship universe every time, we decided to invest that effort into curating some best practices specific to the fellowship program.

# Topics

content will be added against these initial topics as mentoring time permits

- [Code for Australia Fellowship blog](https://blog.codeforaustralia.org/tagged/fellowship)
- Managing risk
- Technology / stack choices
- Validation of architecture
- Market research / validation
- Stakeholder communication
- Identifying blockers
- Setting milestones/deliverables, expectations
- What's an MVP

# Who

  - [coming soon] [meet the current mentors](./mentors.md)
  - [in progress] [previous cohorts](./archives/README.md) contains project briefs, meeting minutes from previous fellowship groups

# How to contribute

- Open an issue requesting clarification of an existing topic, or information on a new topic
- Open a pull request with proposed changes and seek a peer review from other fellows and mentors
