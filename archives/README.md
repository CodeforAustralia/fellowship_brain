### Corrections

A Community Correction Order is a court-imposed order that allows a sentence to be served in the community that consists of a series of conditions that need to be complied with. This is composed of some mandatory terms that must be complied with, such as not reoffending, reporting to a community corrections centre; as well as conditions that are specific to an individual, like community work, rehabilitation, a curfew, or supervision by a case manager. A Parole Order is pretty similar, but differs in some of the specific conditions, and is only required for offenders on parole.

There is a negative correlation between offenders who successfully complete their orders and those who re-offend. Corrections Victoria are looking for ways to improve compliance outcomes, and also to innovate and bring the department into the 21st century.

CV have proposed developing a mobile application for offenders that they can use to self-manage the conditions of their order, provide information regarding the order, and facilitate access to support services.

### DHHS

DHHS Public Housing are currently sending most communications to their clients via Post. The letters are communication across the whole system - both in application and tenancy stages.

As Australia Post have extended their delivery times and increased their letter costs, this has significantly affected their service delivery.


The problems faced are:

- The extended delivery times means clients who have letters to action (eg. Offers of Housing) within a 7 day time limit, are no longer possible.
- Some letters are sent to clients who are homeless, without a fixed address, are not delivered to their clients.
- Sending of the letters represents a higher cost for the Department.
- The timeliness of information is important for public housing clients. For example, clients must complete bond loan applications quickly to secure private rental accommodation opportunities. Missing an opportunity to secure accommodation, especially for homeless clients, can compound disadvantage.

### DSCV

A tool to help clients access information and solve disputes themselves.

The Dispute Settlement Centre of Victoria (DSCV) is a major government provider of free alternative dispute resolution services to the public. Using DSCV services is a cheaper and simpler alternative to taking civil disputes through the courts, but demand is increasing for both phone and mediation services.

Currently around 90 per cent of neighbourhood disputes are referred to DSCV from local councils including issues relating to fences, trees, animals, noise, drainage and anti-social behaviour.

Clients can often solve their own disputes but have difficulty accessing information on rights and responsibilities. DSCV are proposing to work with the Fellows to develop a tool that:

- helps people understand their rights and responsibilities
- introduces online dispute resolution options by providing people with tools to solve disputes
themselves, including self-mediation
- initiates intake processes if disputes require further DSCV support
- is available 24/7 to enable access outside business hours and relieve pressure on the call
centre
- is available in languages other than English
- supports dispute resolution services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities
- gathers data on emerging trends to inform policy and continuously improve DSCV services.
