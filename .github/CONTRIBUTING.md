# Got a question about adding something?

If it's a "how do I do X" question, try asking in the Code for Australia slack first.

If it's a "what about including [some-info] in this repo" question, you have 2 options:

## 1. Open a pull request

Clone the repository into your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/CodeforAustralia/fellowship_brain.git`

Make a branch, using a terse but meaningful name: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`


Introduce your [changes](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line/), and open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Ask in the Code for Australia slack for someone to peer-review your pull request. Reviewers typically leave a :+1: to signify their approval. If they suggest changes, discuss them in the pull request and make additional changes to your branch.

Once you have approval, you can merge your pull request. Look for the big green button at the bottom of the page.

## 2. Open an issue

Don't feel comfortable or ready to open a pull request? [Open an issue](https://github.com/CodeforAustralia/fellowship_brain/issues/new) instead. Provide as much detail as you can, then ask in the Code for Australia slack for people to review and comment on your issue.

Hopefully, that discussion will lead to a pull request.
